Today's blog is a reflection on selected article readings from [OpenSource](https://opensource.com). [OpenSource](https://opensource.com) [OpenSource](https://opensource.com) is a publication that is supported by RedHat that provides resources with a focus on open source and Linux. They provide useful information such as [cheat sheets](https://opensource.com/downloads/cheat-sheets) for tools such as ssh, python, or bash and [lists of open source alternatives](https://opensource.com/alternatives) to many proprietary softwares/services that are used today. I highly recommend visiting their page of cheat sheets and downloading a copy for tools you are using or learning.   
Now back to the topic at hand. I perused the selection of articles and two caught my interest. The first was [Why KubeEdge is my favorite open source project of 2020](https://opensource.com/article/21/1/kubeedge). This article features a combination of very hot topics in today's world of software development. KubeEdge is an open source project that is bringing Kubernetes to the world of IoT and edge computing. Edge computing is an up and coming philosophy that seeks to put computation and data storage as close as possible to an endpoint where it is needed for a myriad of reasons, but to improve response times. An example: a more classic approach is to have a standard server client relationship where clients store as little information as possible and only serve to get and post raw data to the server. Then the server is the point where the majority of computation and data storage is done. An edge computing paradigm would instead put more of the burden on the client to do possible computation and data storage.  
There are many large challenges in implementing an edge computing ecosystem in IoT. A few are smart data processing, security, and network reliability. This is why Kubernetes was chosen. At its core, KubeEdge has two parts: Cloud and Edge. The Cloud is the location of the Kubernetes Master component, EdgeController, and edge CloudHub are located. In short, the CloudHub is a communication module that ensures that changes in the Cloud are sent to the EdgeHub. The EdgeController is self explantory. On the other side, the Edge is where edge nodes are contained. In addition to the EdgeHub, there is the Edged, MetaManager, DeviceTwin, and EventBus. Edged handles the kubelet's job on the nodes. MetaManager persists node-level metadata. DeviceTwin syncs devices between the Cloud and Edge. Lastly, the EventBus manages internal edge communications. This quick overview really helped solidify the design of KubeEdge in my mind and has made me very interested in the deployment of a service that uses KubeEdge.
The second article I came across was [10 ways big data and data science impacted the world in 2020](https://opensource.com/article/21/1/big-data). This article covered an array of new topics of open source contributions to data science. I learned of an open source alternative to Google Analytics called Plausable Analytics which has its source code [here on Github](https://github.com/plausible/analytics). Another interesting piece was how to quickly do data modeling with JavaScript simply using the Lodash javascript library to easily update objects with nested properties. Lastly, there was an interesting part that showed how to map and visualize the global spread of COVID-19 in python using Pandas and Plotly.  
There were quite a few other interesting articles but these are the two that most interested me. Once again I highly recommend taking a peek at [OpenSource](https://opensource.com). That is all from me today, have a great day!
