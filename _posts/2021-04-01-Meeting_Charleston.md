Hey there! Today I will be talking about an experience I had at a networking event earlier on in March.
In the past, Charleston has had a plethora of tech networking events to choose from. However, the events
of the last year have taken a toll on the networking scene down here. Many cool events have been postponed
or transitioned to online formats. As a result it was difficult to find an event to attend, but eventually 
I did find an event that I was interested in. Earlier in March, the networking group Charleston Data Science
hosted a presentation/chat about doing technical presentations in a business environment. It was an extremely
useful presentation that went over how to deliver information to different types of audiences. Very often
software/data science people want to get into the nitty gritty details of finding out why and how a goal
was achieved. As a result, they tend to orient their presentations in such a way. 

Our presenter, Dave Ingram described how this was a sub par way to form presentations. From his experiences 
he had found that non-technical audiences heavily prefer shorter presentations that quickly describe a problem
and recommend an answer fast. If one was using a powerpoint format he recommended keeping the general presentation
to a max of 4-7 slides containing that information. But his key point was to bring all supporting material as well.
So if someone wanted to further discuss the topic it could be discussed more in depth.

I found this very counter intuituve initially, however Dave convinced me through his main justification. It was
the fact that every successful presentation must know its audience. A deep technical presentation is lost on a
non-technical audience. This happy medium that he prescribed of creating a short and to the point presentation
with additional material as backup is the perfect way to reach both sides of a buissness oriented audience.
Some higher ups just want to know the results, while others want to know the reasoning behind the results. This
method allows a presenter to handle both cases in an effective manner without losing the other. All in all this
was an extremely valuable event for me to attend and I am looking forward to more events with them in the future.
