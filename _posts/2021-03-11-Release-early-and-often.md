Back again with another post! This is regarding one of the most neglected pieces of the software development process--documentation. Everyone in software development has heard the horror stories of onboarding onto a project that has poor documentation. But I would like to reflect on my experiences with my open source project Zulip and my experiences with its amazing documentation.  

Zulip has a large open source community, and as a result has a high velocity of people interacting with the project. So one of the problems they had to address was creating an effective onboarding experience through documentation and community interaction. Their solution to this was to create a extremely robust documentation at [Zulip documentation hub](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This website was my bible when I was onboarding onto the project and when I was making contributions. It's content covered everything from a brief history about the service, FAQ's, to in depth contribution guides to specific pieces of the codebase. There was not a single process or piece of the codebase that was not addressed in the documentation in my experiences. This is valued so highly in the Zulip community that they include testing to check if feature additions to the codebase contain an update to the documentation. 

Not only this, the presentation of the content itself is amazing as well. The documentation is written in a simple and straight forward style that breaks down any possible barriers to understanding. The language that is used is technical and the structure of documentation pages are process-oriented to mimic how the codebase functions. It's structure also anticipates readers progress, meaning each page contains references to other pages that relate or continue to information presented on that page. Lastly, there is consistency between the language used in the codebase from its variables and comments to the language used in the documentation so it can function as a side by side reference text for making contributions to the codebase.

I was lucky in my experiences with Zulip to learn the lesson of great documentation the easy way! It showed my how critical and effective good documentation can benefit a software project on every front. I could not imagine how much harder it would have been to onboard onto the project without its docs.
