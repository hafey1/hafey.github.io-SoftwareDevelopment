Welcome to my CSCI: 462 Blog. My name is Robert Niggebrugge and I am currently a Senior at the College of Charleston. I am finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science. I participate in Dr. Bowring's research lab known as CIRDLES where I help make some software that helps  geochronological labs and scientist with their workflow. I am also a member of CofC's chapter of ACM. We put on workshops and fun events for students in our department and campus wide. Some other things I do for fun are surf, video games, and learn new tech. Over the break I found a great full stack tutorial on youtube that helped me learn about creating a whole scalable web app from scratch using some modern libraries, tools, and frameworks. Other than that I am looking forward to this semester.

I have some very interesting classes on my schedule this semester. Firstly, I have this class which is another great chance to dive into the open source world and contribute to something that people use! This in addition to the readings and materials covered are a wonderful reason to be in this class. I also have DATA 210 and CSCI 470 which are both classes diving into the data science side of the department. I haven't been able to get a data science class lined up for over a year so I am eager about the chance to interact with the material again. Lastly but not least, I have CSCI 392 which is an ethics in software development course. It is taught by Professor Stalvey, who I have not had a chance to be a student of hers for almost a year. I always enjoy being in her classes. All in all I have a very good semester lined up! That is all from me for now, stay tuned for more commentary and progression as I blog through Spring 2021. Stay safe and have fun!
