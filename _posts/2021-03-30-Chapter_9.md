Back once again, this time to reflect on Chapter 9 entitled "Continuing the Journey". This chapter covers the process and implications of handing off a software project from the initial developers to the maintainers for continued support. The most interesting thing from my perspective is the shift in responsibilities and tasks of a given developer moving from the pre-deployment model to the post-deployment model. Even though there is emphasis on creating a sustainable and managable product during the pre-deployment phase of a project, the majority of the concern is still placed upon getting the project up to a point of deployment. Whereas in post-deployment obviously there is a shift in priority to long term support.

With the priority upon long term support, a lot more effort gets put into creating a system and/or community that facilitates constant and ongoing support. This phase relies heavily on creating a social system as opposed to a software system and it is just as important! This speaks to the ever growing importance of developers with broader skill sets. During this phase, the most valuable developer is the one that knows how to build a community as well as how to make the system.
